  ## Description
  This application was designed to create README files for future projects without the need to generate and format new Markdown with each new project repository.

  ## Installation
  Use this application to generate README files unique to your project. You'll need to clone this repository and install the required dependencies. You can then access project from your command line.

  ## Usage
  Every repository needs a high-quality README. This project can quickly generate a unique README by using command line prompts to autofill an already formatted and styled Javascript file which then uses the dynamically created content to autofill and create a custom README file.
